# Blossom Algorithm

A C++ implementation of the famous blossom algorithm for maximum matchings in general graphs. It was developed by Jack Edmonds in 1961, a detailed description can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blossom_algorithm).

For the algorithm a custom Graph class is used, which stores undirected graphs.
